# OVERVIEW

Basically, Machine Learning Operations is applying DevOps principles like deploying a model, consuming endpoints and automating a pipeline. We show a end to end Operationalizing Machine Learning:

- Auto ML model
- Deploy the best Model
- Enable Login
- Consume model endpoints
- Create and publish pipeline

We don't include Autentication step because was done for us in the enviroment. We start running a an Automated ML experiment to deploy the best model.

Next, we enable Application Insight to review information about the service when consuming model.

Finally, we'll create and publish a pipeline. At the end of this file, you can find a screencast with step-by-step process
